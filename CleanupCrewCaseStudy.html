              <h3 class="margin-bottom_five">The team conducted user interviews and distributed a user survey to understand habits and routines around cleaning trash bins as well determine level of interest for  a business that cleans the bins for you. We concluded that trash routines differ from locations, type of house, and residential vs commercial, but most people care about keeping germs and bacteria from spreading. Created a proto-persona that represented the type of person that would use this service and what would contribute to their decision to become a subscriber. Used empathy mapping to analyze interview data, graphs and pie charts for survey results.</h3>

              <h3 class="margin-bottom_five">4 participants completed the user testing tasks of creating an account, sigining into the app, and then scheduling an appointment for weekly cleaning of bins.  Each user successfully completed the required tasks and the results were analyzed in a 2x2 matrix.  All users agreed the service was an interesting idea and their suggestions to improve the service were to offer options for a vacation hold if you were a subscriber, offer additional forms of payment like PayPal, options for placement of clean bins, and specific times of day for service.</h3>
