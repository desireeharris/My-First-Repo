          <h2 class="hero-container_sub-copy">I worked on a team of designers to redesign a charity's mobile and desktop websites. The primary goal was to increase opportunities for users to make donations to the charity through the website while gaining their trust in the work of the charity by adding transparency of where funds are distributed. </h2>

              <h3 class="margin-bottom_five">The team conducted user interviews with the goal of understanding how people interact with charitable organizations like Child’s Play. Through empathy mapping and creating an affinity diagram, we concluded that people like to donate time and money and look for organizations that are transparent about how donated funds are distributed. We used these findings to create a proto-persona that represented the type of person that would donate to the Child’s Play charity and how they would the charity’s website.</h3>

              <h3 class="margin-bottom_five">We completed a competitor analysis that compared one direct competitor and two indirect competitors of Child’s Play charity. Through this analysis, we identified features to incorporate into our redesign like simplifying the  navigation,  using a brighter color palette, and increasing opportunities to go directly to donation page.  From there, we wrote a problem statement and determined increasing transparency of the charity’s allocation of donated  funds will boost users’ trust in charity and also highlighting emotions of donors, recipients, and the recipients support network will motivate users to make donations.</h3>

              <h3 class="margin-bottom_five">Created two storyboards; one to capture ways to donate and emotions tied to making a donation and second was to bring powerful information from testimonials of healthcare workers in the support network to highlight how the gaming systems boost mood and morale of patients who receive them. Mood board focused on motto "power of play", images that showed donors, recipients, support network, and call to action to donate, all very bright and fun and happy.  Style guide main color as dark purple, secondary high contrast green, type san serif so messaging is clear and easy to read.</h3>

              <h3 class="margin-bottom_five">The team started with desktop wireframes, then built mobile wireframes in Figma. Used elements identified in heuristic evaluation to keep messaging clear, incorporate use of white space, and update information architecture.  Most noticeable updates made from sketches to lo-fi to hi-fi prototypes were messaging to encourage others to participate like when signing up for the newsletter and confirming donation was made and payment was received, showing sponsors logos as a carousel of images instead of static space on page, and the links included in the footer.</h3>

              <h3 class="margin-bottom_five">We had 3 participants in our user testing session. There were 3 tasks to perform, each paticipant successfully completed all tasks.  Feedback we used to iterate designs: "Store" L2 was confusing and was updated to "Merch".  Not enough and obvious ways to reach donation page, so we added one to top nav and other places on homepage.  Feedback to add links on donation confirmation page for users to share to social media pages that they donated and encourage others to donate too, so we did.</h3>

Creating a new website design to achieve specific goals, like getting more users to make donations and creating a new design that builds th user's trust in the charity.  Future opportunities would be to redesign the Merch store, build out donation pages for shopping an amazon wishlist, and to build the network of hospitals and shelters page.</h3>
